# Bun, Astro, and HTMX experiment

Install:

```sh
bun install
```

Run local development:

```sh
bun dev
```

## Bun

An alternative runtime to Node.js. It is faster, and more importantly has a lot of built in tooling. No third-party bundlers, compilers, test runners, etc.

## Astro

A web framework for building static and dynamic pages. The default output is HTML and doesn't require javascript. It uses the MPA (multi page application) pattern instead of SPA (single page application), which results in much less complexity.

## HTMX

A librabry for building dynamic interactive web applications. It does not require any custom javascript to make web applications without full page reloads.

## Other libraries

### Alpine.js

A lightweight client side javascript library for updating the DOM. Used mainly for simple interactions that does not require the server.

### Tailwind

A styling framework using utility classes. Only uses CSS without the need of a runtime.
